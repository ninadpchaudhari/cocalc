## Project Purpose

This fork aims to preserve the final AGPL-licensed version of CoCalc for:
- Research into collaborative computation platforms.
- Educational use in classrooms and universities.
- Archival purposes, so future developers can study its design.

The code in this repository is based on [CoCalc](https://github.com/sagemathinc/cocalc), prior to the license change from AGPL to the [Commons Clause](https://commonsclause.com/).

## About CoCalc (Official Project Description)

The following description comes directly from the official CoCalc project:

> CoCalc is web-based software that enables collaboration in research, teaching, and scientific publishing.  
> It includes [Jupyter Notebooks](https://cocalc.com/features/jupyter-notebook), [Sage Worksheets](https://cocalc.com/features/sage), a [LaTeX Editor](https://cocalc.com/features/latex-editor), and a [Linux Terminal](https://cocalc.com/features/terminal) to help people work together in real time from different locations.  
> It also has a [Computational Whiteboard](https://cocalc.com/features/whiteboard) for expressing and sharing ideas and running code.  
> CoCalc supports sophisticated calculations that arise in teaching, research, and authoring documents — including Python, SageMath, Julia, R, Octave, LaTeX, and more.
