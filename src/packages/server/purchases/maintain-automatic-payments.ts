/*
For each account where the most recent recent statement with interval "month"
has a negative balance, we automatically create a payment intent for the
amount of the negative balance and message the account.

If the charge goes through, then the user will get credited to the account.

// but no other condition (except that the account has stripe_usage_subscription
// not null) and uses the ROW_NUMBER() trick so we can grab the most recent one.
