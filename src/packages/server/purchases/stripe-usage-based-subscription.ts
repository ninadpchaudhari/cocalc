/*
Managing a Stripe usage-based subscription created via Stripe Checkout.

- creating a new subscription
- retrieving the subscription ID for a user
- retrieving a list of usage-based subscriptions for a user
- setting the subscription ID
- adding usage to a subscription.


This is basically a *hack* to provide a way to automatically collect
money from a user periodically.  The problem is that Stripe Checkout's
mode:'setup' requires figuring out exactly what payment methods to
support, which makes absolutely no sense at all.  See
             create-stripe-payment-method-session.ts
for more details.

The way this hack works is that we -- once and for all -- make a
product called "cocalc-automatic-billing" in stripe, if it doesn't
already exist.  This product costs exactly one penny and is metered,
so we can add any amount we want of it.

For each user there is a day d, once per month, when the following happens:

- A: we create their monthly statement, which shows their balance on this day
- B: we compute the cost to renew all of their active monthly (or yearly)
  subscriptions. These subscriptions should all be defined so that their
  renewal is on day d + 3.
- we add to the usage-based subscription the sum of the above amounts: A+B
- we update the subscription's billing_cycle_anchor to now as explained here
   https://stripe.com/docs/api/subscriptions/update
  which causes an immediate invoice of the subscription and crediting the
  user's account.
- if their account is credited with a credit coming from their usage-based
  subscription, we credit their account, then immediately renew their subscriptions.

Note that we assume 1 <= d+3 <= 28, so that d <= 25.  This provides plenty of
wiggle room in case the usage-based subscription fails.

If the user doesn't have a usage based subscription we still compute A,B, but
we also send the user an email encouraging them to sign in and add credit to
their account (if necessary) so that their subscriptions will renew.

NOTE: All currencies presented to the user are in US dollars, unfortunately,
as documented at https://stripe.com/docs/payments/checkout/present-local-currencies where
it says "Automatic currency conversion doesnâ€™t apply for any Sessions with multi-currency
prices, subscriptions".
