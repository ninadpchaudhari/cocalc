/* Checks that name satisfies the following constraints
Inspired by -- https://github.com/isiahmeadows/github-limits

Each function checks the basic rules, but NOT for uniqueness,
which requires a DB query.

If a rule fails, throws an Error.

The URL schema is

https://cocalc.com/[account name]/[project name]/[shared path name]

We are only using these URL's for the share server.
We only use such a URL if all segments are specified.

NOTE: at some point we considered using these url's for more than just
the share server, and maybe when some segments aren't specified.  If we
did that, we have to have a lot more constraints on the segments, e.g.,
we can't allow "files" for the shared path name.  But we are NOT doing
that.
