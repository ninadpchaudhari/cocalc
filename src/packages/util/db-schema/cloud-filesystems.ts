/*
Configuration of network mounted shared POSIX filesystems associated
to projects for use initially by the compute servers.

Initially these will get mounted by all compute servers uniformly (mostly),
and later the project will also mount these via a sidecar.

This is 100% built on juicefs/keydb instead of gcs/s3, etc., since:

- there are so many gotchas with directly using fuse mounted gcs/s3,
- people can just use those directly or mount them directly easily
  anyways (since they are root)
