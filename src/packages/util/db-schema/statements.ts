/*
NOTES

What's a statement?

- id - numerical
- account_id -- of the user
- time -- when statement created; will be midnight UTC for a given day.
- balance -- current running balance up to exact time of statement, which is by definition sum of all purchase costs ever
- total_charges -- sum of debits during the statement period (a non-positive number)
- num_charges
- total_credits -- sum of the credits during the statement period (a non-negative number)
- num_credits

A statement contains by definition every transaction with time <= created that is not on some existing monthly or daily statement.

We make the statement by doing a query for every purchase with timestamp <= cutoff time and daily_statement_id (or monthly_statement_id) not set.  This ensures that even if a statement were somehow missed one day, it would be included the next day.

- compute total_charges/num_charges and total_credits/num_credits directly via a query
- compute balance from total_charges, total_credits and the balance number off the previous statement (if there is one).

The transactions that correspond to a statement are in the database and can be queried easily.

We make statements for each account for which there is at least one purchase that isn't associated to a statement.
Thus if there is no statement at a point in time for a given account, then there shouldn't be any purchases.

For pay as you go purchases, the purchase isn't included in a statement until the cost is set (i.e., when
the purchase is finalized).  So if the purchase starts on day 1 and ends on day 2, it goes on the day 2
statement.

IMPORTANT: I did NOT make the pair (account_id, time) in the statements table uniq.  If somehow a new
purchase were created that was in the same time period as an existing statement (which should never happen,
but who knows - maybe there is a bug or a clock is off in the database (?)), then we will end up with
two valid statements with the same date. There's no overlap between them in terms of the numbers or counts,
and they just represent different purchases.
