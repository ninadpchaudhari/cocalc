- get x11 to work sensibly without using primus, using pub/sub instead of a primus channel \(?\).
- Build upstream xpra\-html5 from source to location of our choice: ~/upstream/xpra\-html5\$ python3 setup.py install \$HOME/upstream/local
- Modify the background image
- Change to just having the standard or slightly modified client in an iframe.
- Get the html from built location.
- Replace the _websocket_ part by NATS proxied pub/sub later.
- this is clearly the way to go
