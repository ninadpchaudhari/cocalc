Code for manipulating the open_files and open_files_order objects in the project store:

  open_files: immutable.Map<string, immutable.Map<string, any>>;
  open_files_order: immutable.List<string>;

Motivation:

These objects in the past sometimes got out of sync, which would result
in not being able to open a file anymore without refreshing your browser,
which is a pretty serious bug.  E.g., that's what would happen if open_files
had path in it but open_files_order didn't.  To reproduce this, open a project
and open files a.txt and b.txt. then in a console type:

   a = smc.redux.getProjectActions('854642c4-d035-4e39-8cff-e05ad836bd20')
   s = a.get_store()
   a.setState({open_files_order: s.get('open_files_order').delete(1)})

and you'll find that you can't open b.txt anymore, since it's halfway opened.

The point of this code here is ensure that these objects stay in sync properly.

** ALL MUTATION of open_files and open_files_order SHOULD GO THROUGH THIS OBJECT!
