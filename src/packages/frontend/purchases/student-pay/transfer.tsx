/*
If the user is NOT a student in another course that they *have* paid the license for, then
this component shows nothing.

If the user is a student in at least one other course that they have paid for the license 
for, then a "Transfer License..." button shows up.  When clicked, it shows a description
and buttons for each of the other courses that qualify.  Clicking on the button uses
a backend api call to actually transfer the license, which makes the current course be
paid for, but the other one is no longer paid for.

The motivation for this is that students switch sections in large classes, and this
minimizes friction.  Also, they pay for a license for the whole course, and getting a
prorated refund and making a new purchase isn't fair.

NOTE: the api call just allows for transfering and doesn't do much of a check, at least for
the first release. That's another way a malicious user could cheat.

NOTE: a concern is that this assumes the student has not been removed from the original
section. If that happens, they would have a license but no longer have the project,
which breaks the logic below.  There's always a problem no matter what you do...
