/*
This is a key:value store that hubs can write to and all
users of cocalc can read from.  It contains:

- recent system-wide notifications that haven't been canceled
  system.notifications.{random}

- the customize data: what used to be the /customize http endpoint
  this makes it so clients get notified whenever anything changes, e.g., when the
  recommended or required version changes, and can act accordingly.  The UI
  can also change.
