/*
NATS Kv associated to a project to keep track of open files.

DEVELOPMENT:

Change to packages/backend, since packages/nats doesn't have a way to connect:

~/cocalc/src/packages/backend$ node

> z = await require('@cocalc/backend/nats/sync').openFiles({project_id:cc.current().project_id})
> z.touch({path:'a.txt'})
> z.get({path:'a.txt'})
{ open: true, count: 1, time:2025-02-09T16:37:20.713Z }
> z.touch({path:'a.txt'})
> z.get({path:'a.txt'})
{ open: true, count: 2 }
> z.time({path:'a.txt'})
2025-02-09T16:36:58.510Z
> z.touch({path:'foo/b.md',id:0})
> z.getAll()
{
  'a.txt': { open: true, count: 3 },
  'foo/b.md': { open: true, count: 1 }

Frontend Dev in browser:

z = await cc.client.nats_client.openFiles({project_id:cc.current().project_id))
z.getAll()
}
