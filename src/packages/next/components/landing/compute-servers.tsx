        Extend your {siteName} projects with powerful{" "}
        <Text strong>compute servers</Text>. They give you much more power, GPU
        options, and flexibility for your computations.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        From within your {siteName} project, spin up and connect to a powerful
        machine. You simply{" "}
        <Text strong>
          tell your terminals and Jupyter Notebooks to run on these machines
        </Text>
        , or with one click launch JupyterLab or VS Code. These compute servers
        open up new possibilities by utilizing enhanced computing resources,
        extending far beyond the bounds of what you can do in your local
        project.
      </Paragraph>

        These servers optionally come with{" "}
        <Text strong>very competitively priced GPU support</Text>, from a single
        NVIDIA T4 to eight H100's, with many options in between, including L4
        and L40, RTX-A4/5/6000, and A100 with 40GB and 80GB. The finely
        configured software images include{" "}
        <A href="https://youtu.be/kcxyShH3wYE">Google Colab</A>, SageMath,
        Anaconda, Julia, <A href="https://youtu.be/JG6jm6yv_KE">PyTorch</A>,
        Tensorflow and <A href="https://youtu.be/OMN1af0LUcA">Open WebUI</A>,
        accommodating a versatile range of uses. The pre-configured software
        environments make it very easy to make use of them, right out of the
        box. You can also run any command as{" "}

          root
        </A>
